            üìù Fix Instructions:
            All lines in Markdown files must be ‚â§120 characters. To fix these violations:

            1. Break long lines at natural boundaries (spaces, punctuation)
            2. Keep each line as close to 120 characters as possible without exceeding it
            3. Maintain readability and proper Markdown formatting
            4. For long URLs or code, consider using reference-style links

            Example fix for a 150-character line:
            Before: "This is an extremely long line that contains too many characters and needs to be broken up into
            multiple lines for better readability."
            After:  "This is an extremely long line that contains too many characters and needs to be broken up into
            multiple
            lines for better readability."

            Run 'standards lint .' again after fixing to verify all lines are within the limit.
