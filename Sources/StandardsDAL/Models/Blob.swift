/// Represents a blob reference stored in object storage (AWS S3) or local filesystem in development and testing.
///
/// **Polymorphism Pattern:**
/// This model uses polymorphism to allow a single blob storage table to be referenced
/// by multiple different entity types. The `referencedBy` field acts as a discriminator
/// that identifies which type of entity is referencing the blob, while `referencedById`
/// contains the UUID of that specific entity.
///
/// This pattern enables:
/// - A single blob storage table that can serve multiple entity types
/// - Consistent blob management across the application
/// - Easier maintenance of file storage logic
/// - Referential integrity through foreign key constraints
